# Cookie-Control-Collective
HTTP cookies, small chunks of data stored on users' local machines by browsers, are essential for many web services. However, cookies are usually specific to web services, meaning both the content and user configuration of cookie data vary across different web services. While it is an inherent character of the cookies, it also poses difficulty for users to view and manage their cookie settings across sites.


This project proposes the development of a Dynamic Cookie Management Dashboard (DCMD), a centralized UI in the form of a browser plugin that allows users to manage their cookie preferences across various platforms on a single dashboard. The dashboard intends to give the user a unified view of their cookie data while simplifying the cookie management process.
